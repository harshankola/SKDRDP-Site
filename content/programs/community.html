            <p>The SKDRDP is active in various parts of Karnataka State 
                through its Community Development Project, to provide infrastructure 
                support to the villages. The project is participatory in nature where, 
                the local people form an implementation committee, implement the project 
                in a time bound manner with local participation in the form of finance 
                and labour. The SKDRDP supports such initiatives by lending its 
                goodwill, grants up to the 50% technical guidance, review and 
                monitoring. The Community Projects are concentrated in the field of 
                education, health, creation of community assets, rural infrastructure 
                and community welfare</p>

                    was taken up in 1990 to create and develop rural assets.</strong> A wing of SKDRDP, 
                it was launched to assist community efforts for the building of infrastructure. 
                Today, the project emphasizes education, rural infrastructure, and the 
                improvement of crematoriums.</p>

            <p><strong>The Hindu Rudrabhoomi Project (Crematorium)</strong> is one such initiative. 
                This unique program serves to complete the last journey of all human beings in a 
                dignified manner. The program supports the local community in renovating existing 
                crematoriums with silicon cremation chambers. Such chambers require as little as 
                250 kg of firewood to burn bodies, as compared to the 800 kg necessary for conventional 
                firewood burning.</p>
            <p>Together with local initiatives and financial sponsors, upgrading, repair and 
                construction works have been carried out in multiple villages, towns and cities.
                Hindu Rudrabhoomi Committee at Belluru, Karnadu, Mulky, Mangalore: The people of 
                Belluru village decided to construct a crematorium in their village and formed a 
                committee for the same. They approached SKDRDP for assistance. The total cost of 
                the project was Rs. 7.50 lakhs which included the construction of burning shed, 
                silicon chamber, a small "Gudi (prayer hall)' for Lord Shiva, a room for stocking 
                wood, leveling of ground, water facility, and plantation and so on.</p>

            <p>SKDRDP is committed to total health and sanitations in rural areas. For this 
                purpose SKDRDP has actively supported construction of individual toilets in 
                villages and towns. For this purpose SKDRDP has popularized several models 
                including the UNICEF model, the twin pit pour flush model.</p>

            <p>On account of our experience, the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure and Development Finance 
                Corporation (KUIDFC) sought the partnership of SKDRDP in constructing 11,500 low cost 
                sanitation (LCS) units in 6 coastal urban towns. As a first step, a unique participatory 
                and transparent strategy was devised wherein the committees of those without toilets 
                would select the mason, choose the materials, purchase them in bulk and reduce the 
                prices of the unit. This practice has effectively speeded up the construction of LCS 
                units in urban areas. The construction started in Udupi town, which saw the completion 
                of 365 units within 45 days. This process was replicated in other towns and more 
                than 7,747 units have been completed since March 2006.</p>

            <p><strong> Shudhaganga project </strong> - Many villages in our country donot have 
                access to pure drinking water. Surface water is often contaminated. Ground water 
                has high fluoride and dissolved solvent making it unsuitable for drinking purpose. 
                Yet people use this water to suffer from various ailments. It is estimated that 
                nearly 90% of the villages suffer from drinking water problems, ranging from supply 
                chains to quality issues.</p>

            <p>Shudhaganga is a unique community effort to produce pure drinking water in the 
                villages by purifying the drinking water at source by a process called 
                <strong>“reverse osmosis”</strong>. A small building sufficient storage tanks 
                for impure and pure water, machinery for purifying the water are the basic requirements 
                of the project. In this plant impure water is taken from the source, purified in the 
                plant and stored in the pure tanks. The users will come and fetch the water in 20 ltr 
                jerry cans. The users pay a nominal fee of Rs. 0.10 per ltr of water which will be 
                utilized for the maintenance of the plant and day to day service. SKDRDP has installed 
                80 plants in Chikamagalur, Gadag, Haveri, Dharwad, Tumkur and Hassan districts helping 
                20,000 families to get pure drinking water everyday. This project has attracted the 
                attention of the Govt.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost of the Program </strong></p>
            <p>Each Shudhaganga plant costs approximately Rs. 10.00 lakhs for commencement of production. 
                Thereafter a monthly maintenance expenditure of Rs. 20,000/- is required. While the 
                installation costs can be sourced from philanthrophic institutions and the govt. maintenance 
                costs have to be reimbursed. For this purpose a charge of Rs. 0.10 per ltr. is collected. 
                In a village if 500 families consume 20 ltrs. of water everyday Rs. 30,000/- is collected 
                every month which will take care of maintenance and servicing. Therefore this is a 
                participatory program where all partners are joining hands to ensure supply of pure 
                drinking water.</p>

            <p>Responding to the request of the Chikamagalur town municipality, the local project 
                office of SKDRDP has taken up the responsibility of collecting waste materials from 
                all houses in the town and depositing them at the secondary disposal point. Initially 
                house to house awareness camp was organised, followed by daily collection. It is 
                heartening to note that 18,418 houses out of 20,350 houses are contributing the wastes 
                daily basis. A total of 40 workers are engaged in collection of the waste, keeping track 
                of the work and managing the same. The households contribute Rs. 20/- every month to 
                make the project sustainable.</p>
