            <p>Developed by SKDRDP, <strong>"Pragathi Bandhus"</strong> are unique models 
                of male-member Self-help Groups that center around the cultivation of 
                waste lands through labor sharing. Such groups organize and empower small and 
                marginal farmers and laborers through the transference of governance to the 
                village level. By promoting compulsory labor sharing for performing individual 
                and community tasks, each village member works for the other members for one 
                day in a week. This has helped thousands of small farmers to complete their 
                important farm works.</p>
            <p><strong>A five year farm plan</strong> prepared by the members in consultation 
                with the group and the Sevaniratha provides the much-needed help to families. 
                Through such collective action, the community can implement watershed construction 
                and development programs. Pragathi Bandhu groups also provide micro-credit assistance 
                primarily for land development, creation of infrastructure and personal emergency 
                needs. They organize themselves into federations and the sub-committees of the 
                federations and study the credit requirement of the groups to make recommendations 
                for credit loans.</p>
            <p>The Pragathi Bandhu model has now been approved by the National Bank for Agriculture 
                and Rural Development and has achieved the significant milestone of being adopted 
                for the implementation of Joint Liability Group (JLG). JLGs are 5 to 10 member 
                groups formed in each project village that act as mutual guarantee groups for 
                bank/MFI credit.</p>

            <img class="img-responsive" src="../../images/programs/sri program.JPG" alt="SRI"/>
            <p>Paddy cultivation in India has been facing stiff competition from cash crop 
                cultivation. Paddy cultivation requires more resources in the form of seeds, 
                water, manure and labor, while only resulting in moderate yield. Most paddy 
                cultivators also tend to be small farmers with holdings of less than two hectares. 
                Many farmers are hence converting their land into horticultural fields. With such 
                lethargic growth in grain production, the Indian subcontinent is slowly 
                heading towards a food security crisis.</p>
            <p>System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which began in the 1980s, is a new 
                method of rice cultivation that uses lesser investments of water and labor 
                resources to increase the yield or productivity, thereby reducing the 
                cost of cultivation. With lesser plants per surface area, varieties of rice 
                plants are usually healthier with a larger root volume, higher grain weight 
                and more insect-resistant qualities.</p>
            <p>The process of SRI begins from early transplanting, with greater tillering and 
                more root growth. Should plants be deemed to have more tillering potential, they 
                are carefully transplanted to a wider space. This will enable more root  growth. 
                Weeding and aeration are subsequently carried out to ensure healthy growth of the 
                plants. Mechanization, in the form of power tillers, cono weeders, and thrashing 
                machines has been proposed to improve upon the efficiency of the processes.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP trains farmers on the implementation of the SRI method and develops a database 
                to track individual performance based upon the yield of the harvest. Farmers are 
                required to keep simple records of the methodologies applied, expenditure and income. 
                The organization undertakes monitoring of the entire project from its initial phase. 
                Beneficiaries will also be assisted physically with loans, whose repayment will be 
                tracked. The outcomes of the individual beneficiary will be measured individually at 
                the SRI promoter, block and district level.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP has been actively involved in promoting SRI since 2004. In 2009, in partnership 
                with the <strong>National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and 
                    AME Foundation</strong> (a NGO engaged in training for agriculture producers), 
                SKDRDP has implemented the SRI project successfully.</p>

            <p>Animal Husbandry is an agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock. 
                Many farmers are of the opinion that animal husbandry is not necessarily profitable 
                as farmers look for direct benefits such as milk and meat and ignore indirect benefits 
                like manure and gobar gas.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP conducts regular awareness camps and demonstrations on animal husbandry to 
                educate farmers on the full range of products that animal husbandry can be used for. 
                SKDRDP constructs low cost sheds, compost and vermi units and gobar gas units. The 
                organization also introduces modern technologies and exotic breeds and high yielding 
                fodder grass varieties such as Azola in order to increase the income of farmers.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP has also expanded its services to become a corporate agent of National 
                Insurance Company and has formally popularized animal insurance for cattle.</p>

            <p>SKDRDP brings in science and technology to help farmers improve the yield and 
                efficiency rate of farming their agricultural plots. The organization works together 
                with local government line departments and research institutions to gather and 
                transfer information to the project offices.</p>
            <p>Each project is provided with exclusive services of agricultural and dairy 
                technologists to guide the farmers and teach them new technologies and agro 
                practices that expand their capabilities. For instance, field level workers are 
                continuously trained in simple cropping techniques for regenerative and sustainable 
                agriculture.</p>
            <p>Expert specialists are invited to give lectures to groups of 40 to 50 farmers on 
                government policies, horticulture and subjects related to agriculture. Such lectures 
                focus on the existing local problems of the farmers. Progressive farmers and other 
                eminent think tanks are also invited for training programs and demonstrations to 
                share their experience.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP also motivates farmers by bringing them on study tours to showcase what other 
                progressive farmers have achieved. This may also include visits to research stations 
                within or outside the district. Study tours may be synchronized with Kissan Mela. 
                Such tours expose farmers to the possibilities of technological adoption and replication 
                for their own farms.</p>
            <p>Other agriculture extension programs include introducing high yielding varieties of crops, 
                encouraging organic farming, liaising between the farmers and research centers, encouraging 
                native inventions and conserving the environment.</p>

                <h2>Barren Land Cultivation<a class="btn btn-info pull-right" href="#top" name="barren">Top</a></h2>
            </div>

            <p>SKDRDP encourages the cultivation of barren private lands by coordinating with various 
                line departments like agriculture and forest, to facilitate equitable distribution of 
                seed materials and other facilities to deserving farmers.</p>
            <p>Un-irrigable dry lands like hilly areas are cultivated with rubber and cashew plantation 
                crops. Special attention is given in these farms to different methods of soil and water 
                conservation such as terracing and bunding that could make the soil arable.</p>

            <!-- Farm Development -->
            <div class="page-header">
                <h2>Farm Development<a class="btn btn-info pull-right" href="#top" name="farming">Top</a></h2>
            </div>

            <p>SKDRDP advocates individual farm development planning annually, which sets targets that 
                provide the direction for the next five years. Plans are drawn with the active involvement 
                of the beneficiary, experts and the project staff. The implementation of the plan takes 
                place in phases.</p>
            <p>SKDRDP aims to promote cultivation in barren wastelands and to optimize the use of 
                available lands through the adoption of scientific methods of agriculture. As such, 
                the five year plans focus on crop cultivation and take into account other factors that 
                could affect the development of the land, for instance, suitability of the land, water 
                and soil conservation structures, fencing and open well construction. The plans also map 
                out and allocate budget for the attainment of personal goals within individual families, 
                such as house construction, electrification of the house, education, marriage and festivities. 
                These plans are recorded into a book to be reviewed by visitors and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p>At every stage, the sevanirathas, supervisors, project officers and auditors inspect and 
                ensure the proper implementation of the plan.</p>
            <p>The sevanirathas, or field level functionaries, are the first line of help who rectify 
                problems and visit the beneficiaries regularly. The supervisors keep track of the 
                activities of the sevanirathas to ensure a good relationship between the beneficiary 
                and the project staff. The supervisors also observe the rate of progress and pay surprise 
                visits to the field to ensure proper implementation of the plan.</p>
            <p>The project officers, auditors and project coordinators monitor the activities through 
                the supervisors and through field visits. They also check financial statements for 
                accuracy of the expenses for a particular activity.</p>

            <p>SKDRDP initiated Watershed Development Programs in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Districts 
                owing to the growing importance of conservation of water. This program stresses the 
                conservation and proper management of water resources, optimum usage of rainwater and 
                education on watershed methodology.</p>
            <p>Awareness programs are conducted to educate farmers on rain water harvesting and 
                water management activities. Several models that are being implemented in the field 
                include percolation pits, agri ponds and borewell recharge activities.</p>
            <p>The major watershed activities conducted include the construction of soak pits, 
                contour bounding, recharging of stone quarries, terracing, improvement of madagas 
                (perennial), the building of vented dams, the avoidance of soil corrosion, 
                afforestation, and the utilization of ground water.</p>
