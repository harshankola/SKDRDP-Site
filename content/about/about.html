            <p><strong>Shri Kshethra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project</strong>,
                popularly known as <strong>
                    <abbr title="Shri Kshethra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project">SKDRDP</abbr></strong>, is a charitable trust
                promoted by Dr. D. Veerendra Heggade. SKDRDP concentrates on the
                empowerment of rural women by organizing Self-help Groups (SHGs) on
                the lines of Joint Liability Groups (JLBs) of Bangladesh and provides
                infrastructure and finance through 
                micro credit for the rural people.
            </p>
            <p>The Shri Ksherta Dharmasthala Rural Development Project
                encompasses all aspects of enriching the rural life. It is currently
                expanding its developmental activities to all the districts of Karnataka. SKDRDP is
                active with its 
                Community Development Programs throughout the state.
                The core strengths of the organization are the blessings of its
                promoters, dedicated band of workers, good will of the stakeholders
                and above all a comprehensive program to better the living environment
                of the chosen areas.During the year SKDRDP has extended its
                area of operation to cover the entirity of Karnataka.</p>
            <p><strong>
                    <abbr title="Shri Kshethra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project">SKDRDP</abbr>&reg; is registered under the Charitable Trust
                    Act of 1920 in the office of Sub-Registrar, Government of Karnataka,
                    Belthangady Taluk, Dakshina Kannada District in the year 1991.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>SKDRDP began to play its role in transfer of technology,
                providing infrastructure, and providing finance through micro credit.
                Besides this, the project concentrated on the empowerment of rural
                women and hence began &apos;Jnanavikasa Program&apos;. In response to the social
                needs of the area the SKDRDP innovated into activities like Janajagruthi,
                Community Development, Siri etc.
            </p>
            <p>A village level worker known as <strong>'Sevaniratha'</strong>
                would approach the stakeholder families, sit with them to prepare a
                five year development plan and assist them to implement the same. The
                Dharmasthala temple has given the required material support like
                equipment's, seed materials on a charity basis. In keeping with the HR
                policy of the organization, the supervisory staff were promoted from
                the sevaniratha cadre in the prevailing areas. This provided a great
                opportunity for the youngsters to show their oraganisational skills in
                the new area. </p>
            <p>In order to give opportunities to the housewives and unemployed young
                women in rural areas who have time and inclination to do social work,
                SKDRDP has developed a new cadre called the <strong>Sevaprathinidhi</strong>,
                who work in their spare time and support the SHG movement in the
                village. Most sevaprathinidhis are women and this has positively
                affected women men ratio in the organisation. </p>
            <p>Large quantities of rice was distributed during the initial
                decades as a compensation for the families while they worked in their
                own lands. the concept of 'Food for Work' was implemented by SKDRDP,
                with a view to develop the lands.   Thus the initial decade of SKDRDP
                can be considered as the charity phase.
            </p>
            <p>In the early 90s, on review of the project, it was realised
                that mere charity does not give the desired result. Hence SKDRDP
                adopted the self-help mode by organizing 
                Self-help Groups (SHGs), more
                on the lines of Joint Liability Groups (JLBs) of Bangladesh.
            </p>
            <p><strong>SKDRDP as a BC and BF of the banks :</strong> SKDRDP
                took an active part in implementing the Financial Inclusion plan of
                the government of India by working as Banking Correspondent and

                Under the programme SKDRDP is promoting Self Help groups enabling the
                poor people in the remote villages to access banking facilities at
                their door steps. SKDRDP is BC and BF to State Bank of India,Union Bank of India,
