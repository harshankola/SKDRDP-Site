                        provide viable answers to the complicated problems of the farming 
                        community in India today. The model has successfully been implemented in 
                        coastal and mainland Karnataka districts consisting of 1,32,000 small 
                        farmers who have been organized in 23,300 Self Help Groups. Furthermore, 
                        the model is entirely self-sustaining. The model, Sampoorna Suraksha is 
                        a self financing multipurpose insurance product to protect the poor 
                        against hospitalization expenses, maternity, death, domiciliary 
                        treatment and accidents. Implemented for over five years now, the model 
                        so far has settled more than 100,000 claims and during this year has 
                        attracted 14,00,000 clients. </p>
